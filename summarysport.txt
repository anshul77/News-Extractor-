Trai recommends no auction for walky-talky service spectrum allocation

New Delhi, Jul 22 () Keeping aside observation of the Supreme Court order in 2G spectrum case that spectrum should be allocated through auction, Trai has recommended allotment of radiowaves without bidding route for PMRTS.
The recommendations have been made after the telecom department requested the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India to suggest appropriate method of spectrum allocation for Public Mobile Radio Trunking Service (PMRTS).
The Supreme Court order in 2012, which cancelled 122 telecom permits that were assigned spectrum administratively for 2G service, said that the spectrum should be assigned transparently through auction.
The DoT in July 2017 has sought regulator's views on method that should be used for spectrum allocation for PMRTS.
Trai also suggested that the existing provision of duration of 20 years for PMRTS license should continue.



SpiceJet tussle: Reprieve for Ajay Singh as tribunal rejects Maran's claim for Rs 1,323 crore for non-issuance of warrants

NEW DELHI: In a major reprieve for SpiceJet promoter-chairman Ajay Singh , an arbitration tribunal last Friday rejected the low cost carrier’s ex-owner Kalanithi Maran’s Rs 1,300-crore claim for loss due to non-issuance of share warrants in a share purchase dispute.The tribunal of three former Supreme Court judges ruled that Maran, who three years back sold his 58.5% stake in SpiceJet to Ajay Singh for Rs 2, is entitled to a refund of over Rs 578 crore towards subscription amount for warrants and preference shares.“The amount that SpiceJet has been asked to pay is already deposited in an escrow account.
So, there is no impact on the company’s balance sheet.
The Tribunal has also allowed a counterclaim of Rs 29 crore in our favour,” said a SpiceJet official.Maran has been involved in a legal tussle with Singh after selling the airline as he alleged 18.9 crore share warrants and preference shares were not issued to him despite him infusing Rs 679 crore in SpiceJet.“In so far as the matter of issuance of warrants was concerned, the tribunal has held that there was no breach by the company in pursuing the approval from relevant authority and since the same was not received for reasons not attributable to the company, the company cannot be held to be in breach or be made liable for damages.
The tribunal has however held that since the warrants/shares cannot be issued any longer the amount of about Rs 308 crore earlier received by the company as advance towards subscription of warrants is to be refunded to claimants along with interest of 12% per annum for a period of 30 months.Accordingly, no further warrants/shares are required to be issued by the Company to the Claimants….
the Tribunal held that the question of damages does not arise and accordingly rejected the Claimants’ claim of damages quantified at Rs.1,323 crore for non-issuance of warrants ,” SpiceJet has told BSE in a filing.



GST slabs can be reduced to 3 in future: Sushil Modi

NEW DELHI: Slabs under Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) can be reduced to three from five at present for the convenience of consumers and businesses though it will take some time, Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi.In an interview to Bhasha, Modi, who also heads the high-level minister panel on GST, said that there are five slabs in GST and "there is an intention to reduce it to three slabs but it will take some time" as it is related to states' revenue.Reacting to questions raised by former finance minister P Chidambaram that why rates of 88 items were not reduced by the GST council in 2017, Modi said: "This is not a decision where only the BJP government is involved.
The decision was taken by the GST Council in which Congress-led governments are also involved".He said that after the implementation of GST, initial efforts were directed towards ensuring zero revenue loss.
With the stabilisation of revenue, the rate on many items were gradually reduced.Mounting attack on Chidambaram, Modi said that states had lost confidence in the then Congress government's policies, because of which GST could not be implemented during its tenure.



GST rate cut, return simplification to increase revenue, compliance: CII

New Delhi, Jul 22 () The decision of the GST Council to cut rates and simplification of return filing process will increase the compliance rate and add to revenue buoyancy, industry chamber CII said today.
The decisions taken in the meeting of GST council on July 21 will greatly benefit trade and industry, CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.
"The attention to reducing rates and simplification of filing of returns as well as widening of input tax credit shall certainly increase the compliance rate and add to revenue buoyancy," CII said.
GST Council also allowed businesses with turnover of up to Rs 5 crore to file quarterly returns -- a move which will benefit 93 per cent of the GST registered taxpayers.
So far, businesses with turnover of up to Rs 1.5 crore were permitted to file returns quarterly.

Asian Games: AIFF condemns IOA's decision to exclude football teams from Asiad contingent

MUMBAI: The All India Football Federation AIFF ) on Sunday condemned the Indian Olympic Association 's (IOA) decision to drop the national football teams from the upcoming Asian Games contingent.
"The Committee strongly condemned Indian Olympic Association's decision to debar football teams from participating in the forthcoming Asian Games scheduled to be held in Jakarta," the AIFF said in a statement after its executive committee meeting here today.The meeting was chaired by AIFF president Praful Patel and attended by top office bearers including secretary Kushal Das.The IOA, earlier this month, omitted the men and women's football teams from the Asian Games contingent, stating that they don't stand a chance to win medals in the continental event to be held in Indonesian twin cities of Jakarta and Palembang.Among other decisions, the committee unanimously ratified the 2018-19 club licensing regulations.Meanwhile, in a further effort to curb age-fraud, the TW3 test, which has been accepted by the Supreme Court as an age verification test as well used extensively by the BCCI, has been implemented by the AIFF for all age-group competitions including club competitions, state tournaments and even national team competitions, the statement further added.The costs for the tests would be borne by the respective clubs and state associations.Also abiding by the FIFA regulations, the Committee ratified the use of five substitutions in age-group competitions along with an extra substitute if the match is stretched to extra-time.The Committee also recommended that a standard draft agreement be circulated to the clubs which will include all clauses which need to be included as per FIFA regulations.
However, the clubs would be allowed to use certain variable clauses as an annexure.
This will be implemented from the 2019-20 season.During the meeting, the Committee was also appraised about update on AIFF's Centre of Excellence coming up in Kolkata and the FIFA Forward programme.It also decided to grant provisional affiliation to Dadra and Nagar Haveli which would later be approved by AIFF's General Body in the AGM meeting later.
