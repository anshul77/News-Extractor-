GST slabs can be reduced to 3 in future: Sushil Modi

NEW DELHI: Slabs under Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) can be reduced to three from five at present for the convenience of consumers and businesses though it will take some time, Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi.In an interview to Bhasha, Modi, who also heads the high-level minister panel on GST, said that there are five slabs in GST and "there is an intention to reduce it to three slabs but it will take some time" as it is related to states' revenue.Reacting to questions raised by former finance minister P Chidambaram that why rates of 88 items were not reduced by the GST council in 2017, Modi said: "This is not a decision where only the BJP government is involved.
The decision was taken by the GST Council in which Congress-led governments are also involved".He said that after the implementation of GST, initial efforts were directed towards ensuring zero revenue loss.
With the stabilisation of revenue, the rate on many items were gradually reduced.Mounting attack on Chidambaram, Modi said that states had lost confidence in the then Congress government's policies, because of which GST could not be implemented during its tenure.



Now, only 35 goods in highest tax bracket of GST

NEW DELHI: The GST Council has pruned the 28 per cent slab by cutting tax rates on 191 goods over the last one year, leaving just 35 items, including AC, digital camera, video recorders, dishwashing machine and automobiles, in the highest tax bracket.There were around 226 goods in the 28 per cent category when Goods and Services Tax (GST) was implemented on July 1, 2017.Over the last one year, the Council, chaired by Union finance minister and comprising state ministers, has slashed rates in 191 items.The 35 goods, which will be left in highest slab once the new GST rates are implemented from July 27, also include cement, automobile parts, tyres, automobile equipments, motor vehicles.
yachts, aircrafts, aerated drinks, betting and demerit items like tobacco, cigarette and pan masala.Experts said going forward as the revenues stabilise, the Council may look at further rationalisation of the 28 per cent slab, to restrict the highest tax slab to super luxury and sin goods.
Deloitte India Partner M S Mani said it would be logical to expect that once the GST collections after the recent reductions stabilise, the remaining items such as televisions of all sizes, dishwashers, digital cameras, air conditioners could be considered for an 18 per cent rate.
"It would be ideal if only demerit goods are retained in the 28 per cent slab so that a gradual movement towards having fewer GST slabs can be initiated," Mani said.After the latest rounds of rate cuts by the GST Council on July 21, only 35 items are left in the 28 per cent tax slab, an official said.The Council brought down tax rates to 18 per cent from 28 per cent on 15 items, including vacuum cleaners, washing maching, 68 cm (27 inch) TV, fridge, laundry machines, paints and varnishes.
"The rate cuts would lead to a revenue loss of about Rs 6,000 crore," the official said.The official, however, said that the revenue loss would be only notional as increased consumption and compliance would lead to more revenues to the exchequer.EY Partner Abhishek Jain said: "The reduction of GST rates from 28 per cent to 18 per cent shows that directionally, the Government seems to be clear that the 28 per cent rate should be restricted to super luxury and sin goods".



Donald Trump: Saudis pump more oil for Trump, then doubt if it's needed

NEW DELHI: Under pressure from US President Donald Trump , Saudi Arabia has rushed to boost oil production -- only to discover that global markets might not yet need it.The kingdom’s crude output surged the most in three years last month, as Trump demanded his ally’s help in cooling gasoline prices and filling in the supply gap that will be created by his sanctions on Iran.
It rejected as “without basis” any concerns that the kingdom was moving to oversupply world markets.
Market sentiment could flip again to focus on worries over whether the kingdom has enough idle production capacity to prevent a shortage emerging on the global market.“We have hardly started to see a reduction in flows from Iran,” said Societe Generale’s Wittner.
“Though there’s a lot of crude coming out from Saudi Arabia now, spare capacity is really going to be the big issue going forward.
And spare capacity is getting very tight very quickly.”



Vehicle insurance: Why you will have to pay more for cars, bikes from September

NEW DELHI: Road accidents have claimed more lives in India than terrorist attacks.
The top court's directive makes it mandatory to have a minimum three-year third-party insurance for four-wheelers and a minimum five-year third-party insurance for two-wheelers.The bench said, "Now, there are people who are dying and there are people who have already died in road accidents.
Number of deaths in road accidents is more than one lakh per year in India.
It is just a precautionary measure.The government should look to improve the road conditions due to which these road accidents take place.
The ones which are densely populated are the worst-affected places in India.A five- or a three-year insurance policy isn't the same as five one-year policies.

GST news: Ministers opt for GST cuts despite officials’ concerns

At the press conference, Goyal, who chaired his first meeting of the Council, suggested that the states had raised several demands.For Saturday’s meeting, the fitment committee had recommended a reduction for 35 items, including some clarifications, while suggesting changes for another 12-15 handicraft items.
There were issues, such as footwear, where the committee had rejected the demand for a reduction to 5% from 18% (only foot wear up to Rs 500 a pair attract 5% tax).
But based on requests from some ministers, the Council went ahead and extended the benefit of the lower levy to footwear that costs up to Rs 1,000.The unease was seen outside the conference hall when ministers and officers broke for tea with some bureaucrats advising ministers to factor in the fiscal cost, which they estimated to be Rs 8,000-10,000 crore annually.
Ministers, however, were of the view that lower rates would lead to higher consumption and better compliance and make up for the “notional loss”.
For states, the concern was limited as the law mandates that the Centre has to bear the loss incurred by states due to implementation of GST.
